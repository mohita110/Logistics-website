🌟 Unique Features in my Website are:
1.	Real-Time Compliance Checker:
•	A user-friendly form where users enter parcel details (item type, value, weight, destination country).
•	As they type, rules run in the background, showing “Compliant ✅” or “Flagged ❌” instantly.
2.	Restricted Items & Countries Database:
•	A searchable database where users can check which items are restricted for each country.
•	Filter by country or item type.
3.	Smart Rule Engine:
•	Add a “Custom Rules” tab where an admin can define new rules (like max value limits, restricted items) without touching code — just simple dropdowns and checkboxes.
4.	Dynamic Shipping Forms:
•	Once a shipment passes all checks, auto-generate a compliance report (PDF/HTML) with all shipment details.
•	A download button for users to keep a record of their parcel’s compliance status.
5.	Gamified Learning Module:
•	Since you already have gamification, add mini-quizzes about shipping rules or simulated shipment scenarios.
•	Reward users with vouchers or points for correctly identifying violations.
6.	Interactive World Map:
•	A map showing countries with their shipping restrictions highlighted.
•	Users click on a country to view its restricted items and shipping policies.
7.	AI-Powered Prediction:
•	Basic version: Use AI to suggest additional documents needed for certain items or countries.
•	E.g., if someone enters “Electronics to Germany over $1000,” a message pops up: “Attach customs declaration form.”
8.	Real-Time Chatbot Integration:
•	Train the chatbot to handle basic queries like:
•	“What items are restricted to the UK?”
•	“What’s the max parcel weight for Japan?”
•	Link it to your restricted items database for dynamic responses.

Would you like me to prepare a prototype flow for the real-time compliance checker or help design the rule engine next? Let’s build something impressive! 🚀
